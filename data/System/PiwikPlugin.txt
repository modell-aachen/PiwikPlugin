This plugin lets you track page views using the [[http://piwik.org][Piwik web analytics]] services.

Piwik is the leading self-Hosted, decentralized, Open Source web Analytics
Platform, used by 460,000 websites in 150 countries. 

In most cases the !JavaScript API is used on the _client side_ to bring
Piwik-based web analytics to your site. However browsers tend to block these
additional third party cookies and services which then results in rather sparse
data being collected.

Alternatively <nop>%TOPIC% uses the REST api of Piwik to track page views on
the _server side_. That is, your Foswiki server talks to a Piwik server
informing it about things going on behind the scene. 

There are a couple of advantages and disadvantages comparing client side vs
server side page tracking:

   * measurements on the server are more reliable as they don't rely on the
     client to cooperate with regards to <nop>JavaScript and cookie settings
   * installing a Foswiki plugin is more standardized compared to injecting
     additional <nop>JavaScript to your site
   * page rendering times are captured on the server and propagated to te Piwik
     analyzer
   * custom site search tools like [[Foswiki:Extensions/SolrPlugin][SolrPlugin]] 
     can hook into the tracking process on the server in a reliable way
   * the Piwik API doesn't have to be exposed to the outside which would
     normally be the case for the browser to be able to contact it
   * some measures like screen size and browser plugins can't be recorded on
     the server 
   * click overlays don't work without piwik-related <nop>JavaScript being
     added to the site

In short: the bulk of interesting data can be captured server side in a more
reliable way while some minor features of Piwik aren't covered yet by data
produced by <nop>%TOPIC%.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

To finish installation, you'll have to configure at least:

   * the ={ApiUrl}= of your Piwik server, e.g. =http://localhost/piwik/piwik.pgp=
   * The ={TokenAuth}= to access advanced features (see the API menu on your Piwik server).
   * the ={SiteId}= of your Foswiki server; this is a numeric id of your sites
     configured in piwik itself
   * the ={QueueDir}= to spool tracked page views while being recorded by Foswiki

Note that you must use different =<nop>SiteIds= in each =VirtualHost.cfg= file
in case you are using [[Foswiki:Extensions/VirtualHostingContrib]], e.g.

<verbatim>
$VirtualHost{PiwikPlugin}{SiteId} = 1;
</verbatim>

Page impressions aren't recored to the Piwik server directly for performance
reasons. Instead, they are spooled in a queue specified by the ={QueueDir}=
configuration setting. Foswiki itself will write to that directory while the
interim =piwik_daemon= has to be started which takes over responsibility
forwarding the records to the actual Piwik server.

---++ Foswiki < 1.2.0

To track rendering times on older Foswikis you need to apply below patch
